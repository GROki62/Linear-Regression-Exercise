# Linear-Regression-Exercise
	The python provided shows a surprising trend in how families spend money on eating away from home.  I cannot identify the lineâ€™s correlation due to how shallow it is.  It was expected that the amount of money spent on food away from home somewhat high and then decreases as the number of kids increased, due to how the scatter plot appeared to be structured.  There was a high concentration of points on the lower end of the y-axis, but just how much was surprising.  I cannot determine what this indicates beyond the fact that people do not spend much on eating out in the United States.  Further economical data is required to reach a conclusion.
